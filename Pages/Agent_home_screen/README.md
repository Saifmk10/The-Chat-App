# Agent Screen

The **Agent Screen** acts as the central hub for all AI agents available in the application.  
This screen does not contain any backend logic; it simply displays the available agents and handles navigation to their respective feature screens.

## 📌 Purpose of This Screen

- Serves as the **root container** for all agents.
- Displays agent widgets in a clean UI.
- Handles **navigation only** — no data fetching or processing happens here.
- Acts as the entry point for all agent-related features.
